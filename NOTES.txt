if w = 1 => then vec4 is a position in space.
if w = 0 => then vec4 is a direction.

MATRIX CHEAT SHEET
[00 10 20 30]
[01 11 21 31]
[02 12 22 32]
[03 13 23 33]

Scale into a new matrix: mat4x4_scale_aniso(result, original, 2, 3, 4)
Scale in-place:          mat4x4_scale_aniso(myMatrix, myMatrix, 2, 3, 4)

Model = Translate * Rotate * Scale

Code order                  = Multiplication order (left to right)
Transform application order = Reverse of multiplication order (right to left)
                              (so backwards in code)

MVP = Projection * View * Model
mat4x4 temp;
mat4x4_mul(temp, view, model);
mat4x4_mul(mvp, projection, temp);

"..." makes sure your project-local version is found even if a system-wide one exists.
